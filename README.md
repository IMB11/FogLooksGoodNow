*This is a Fabric port of the original mod with some extra features and tweaks, the original Forge version can be found [here.](https://modrinth.com/mod/fog-looks-good-now)*

In addition to this, the mod adds:

- Configurable fog start and fog end.
- Configurable cave fog start.
- Configurable cave fog color.
- Configurable weather-related fog (rain, thunder etc.)

## Configuration

You can access the configuration either directly through the JSON file or through mod menu if it is installed.
